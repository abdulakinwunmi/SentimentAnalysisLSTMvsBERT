Comparing LSTM and BERT for sentiment analysis on Amazon Kindle reviews

Conducted sentiment analysis of Amazon Kindle reviews by extracting data from Kaggle and using natural language processing (NLP) to determine the polarity of each review. 

Built a recurrent neural network (RNN) with high classification accuracy to classify the polarity of reviews and a BERT model to compare with RNN with the aim of determining which model is best suited for analysing customers' feedback on market product.
